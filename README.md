## General Information
- Repositories are classes or components that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources. 
- Repositories centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used   to access databases from the domain model layer
- Repositories, also, support the purpose of separating, clearly and in one direction, the dependency between the work domain and the data   allocation or mapping.
- A repository performs the tasks of an intermediary between the domain model layers and data mapping, acting in a similar way to a set of domain   objects in memory
